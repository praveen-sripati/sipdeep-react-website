                The company is setting up a mineral water plant in thane, a
                suburb of mumbai. One of the directors mr.aparajit chandrabhan
                shukla on his visit to germany grabbed the idea and started to
                research about alkaline & antioxident water and its health
                benefits. After extensive search he could not procure any
                antioxident water (product) anywhere. Thus the thought process
                started to research on setting up a plant to manafacture
                alkaline & antioxident water. This water filteration machine
                plant is totally a inhouse designed. Various parts are being
                manufactured in india, also spare parts are being imported from
                china and other countries. The technical support is from japan.
