                    "Our team has been studying alkaline water for more than a
                    decade and saw an opportunity to create a better product
                    that we all could feel good about drinking. So we brought
                    together a unique group of professionals, scientists, and
                    water engineers to create the highest quality, chemical free

                    Water is important to every cell, tissue, and organ in your
                    body. The best way to stay hydrated Some people claim that
                    alkaline water is better than anything you could get from
                    the tap. But the science isn't there to back it up. Water is
                    a combination of hydrogen and oxygen. That's why you call it
                    H2O. The amount of hydrogen ionic in water is measured as
                    pH. Alkaline water has less hydrogen -- or a higher pH --
                    than regular water. Water’s pH level ranges from 0 to 14,
                    Alkaline water enthusiasts claim that its increased hydrogen
                    provides greater hydration than regular water, especially
                    after a hard workout. They blame plain water's low pH for
                    all sorts of health problems, from osteoporosis to cancer.

                    <strong>Water chlorination:</strong>&nbsp; Water
                    chlorination is the process of adding chlorine or chlorine
                    compounds such as sodium hypochlorite to water. This method
                    is used to kill certain bacteria and other microbes in tap
                    water as chlorine is highly toxic. In particular,
                    chlorination is used to prevent the spread of waterborne
                    diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. the raw
                    water, after chlorination is required to be stored to
                    achieve a detention time as per process.

                  <p>
                    <strong>R/o Purification:</strong>&nbsp; Purification
                    process that uses a partially permeable membrane to remove
                    ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from drinking
                    water, RO system rejects all the micro-organisms like
                    bacteria & virus.

                  <p>
                    <strong>UV Disinfection:</strong>&nbsp; Ultra Violet System
                    (UV) is a water purification method used to disinfect the
                    bacteria from the water. The ultraviolet rays perforate the
                    harmful pathogens in your home's water and kill the illness
                    causing microorganisms by attacking their genetic core.

                    <strong>Ionizer:</strong>&nbsp; Ionized water helps to
                    improve health condition and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
                    Ionized water helps fight and prevent disease like
                    arthritis, skin disorders, overweight, diabetes and cancer.
                    Alkaline water restores the body's pH balance, work as a
                    powerful antioxidant and maintain hydration at the cellular
                    level.

                    <strong>Ozonation:</strong>&nbsp; Ozone is used in water
                    treatment for its oxidative qualities. Ozone oxidizes both
                    organic & inorganic substances. One of the fastest and most
                    thorough disinfection oliotreatments available for water,
                    ozone does not lead to the formation of trihalomethanes
